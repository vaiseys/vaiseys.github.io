I pursue these questions in the broader interdisciplinary context of cultural evolution.\nI also do a lot with applied statistics. I have been working on how to use simple patterns in repeated cross-section and panel data to help adjudicate between competing theories of cultural change and socialization.\nI teach several short courses on applied statistics through Statistical Horizons and direct their Code Horizons initiative.\nYou can check out my work on Google Scholar."
