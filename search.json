I pursue these questions in the broader interdisciplinary context of cultural evolution.\nThe past few years I have been working on how to use patterns in longitudinal data to help adjudicate between competing theories of cultural change and socialization.\nI teach several short courses on applied statistics through Statistical Horizons and I direct their Code Horizons initiative.\nYou can check out the rest of my work on Google Scholar."
