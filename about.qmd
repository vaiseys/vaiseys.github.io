I am Professor of Sociology and Political Science and Director of the [Worldview Lab](https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/worldview-lab/){target="_blank"} at Duke University.

### Research Interests

The main goal of my research is to understand moral and political beliefs: what they are, where they come from, and what they do. I pursue these questions in the broader interdisciplinary context of [cultural evolution](https://culturalevolutionsociety.org/){target="_blank"}.

The past few years I have been working on how to use patterns in longitudinal data to help adjudicate between competing theories of cultural change and socialization.

I teach several short courses on applied statistics through [Statistical Horizons](https://statisticalhorizons.com/){target="_blank"} and I direct their [Code Horizons](https://codehorizons.com/){target="_blank"} initiative.

You can check out the rest of my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cr6RG1QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){target="_blank"}.
